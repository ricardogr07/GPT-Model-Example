Tables:
Sure, here's an example using a fictional e-commerce database:

# Tables:
- Customers (customer_id, name, email, phone, address)
- Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
- Order_Items (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
- Products (product_id, name, description, price, category_id)
- Categories (category_id, name, description)

Prompt 1:
Here's the query to calculate the total revenue generated by each category:

```
SELECT c.name AS category_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_revenue
FROM Categories c
JOIN Products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN Order_Items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN Orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

This query joins the `Categories`, `Products`, `Order_Items`, and `Orders` tables together and calculates the total revenue for each category by multiplying the quantity and price of each order item and summing them up. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by category name.

Answer 1:
Here is a SQL query that calculates the revenue for each category and the cumulative distribution of revenue for each category:

```
WITH CategoryRevenue AS (
    SELECT c.name AS category_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS revenue
    FROM Categories c
    JOIN Products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
    JOIN Order_Items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY c.name
)
SELECT category_name, revenue, CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS cume_dist
FROM CategoryRevenue;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The `WITH` clause creates a temporary table called `CategoryRevenue` that contains the name of each category and the total revenue for that category.
2. The revenue is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each order item by the price of the product and summing the results.
3. The `JOIN` statements connect the `Categories`, `Products`, and `Order_Items` tables based on their respective IDs.
4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by category name.
5. The main query selects the category name, revenue, and the cumulative distribution of revenue for each category.
6. The `CUME_DIST()` function calculates the cumulative distribution of revenue for each category based on the order of revenue in descending order.

Summary: This SQL query calculates the revenue for each category and the cumulative distribution of revenue for each category.

Prompt 2:
Identify the top 5 customers by total amount spent

Answer 2:
Here is a SQL query that calculates the cumulative distribution of customer spending for the top 5 customers:

```
-- Create a temporary table that calculates the total spending for each customer
WITH CustomerSpending AS (
    SELECT c.name AS customer_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spending
    FROM Customers c
    JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.name
)
-- Select the customer name, total spending, and cumulative distribution over total spending
-- for the top 5 customers by total spending
SELECT customer_name, total_spending, CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY total_spending DESC) AS cume_dist
FROM CustomerSpending
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `CustomerSpending` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The `CustomerSpending` table calculates the total spending for each customer by joining the `Customers` and `Orders` tables on the `customer_id` column and grouping by the customer name.
3. The main query selects the customer name, total spending, and cumulative distribution over total spending for the top 5 customers by total spending.
4. The `CUME_DIST()` function calculates the cumulative distribution of total spending over all customers, ordered by total spending in descending order.
5. The `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by total spending in descending order.
6. The `LIMIT` clause limits the results to the top 5 customers by total spending.

Summary: This SQL query calculates the cumulative distribution of customer spending for the top 5 customers by total spending. It uses a common table expression to calculate the total spending for each customer and the `CUME_DIST()` function to calculate the cumulative distribution.

Prompt 3:
Calculate the CUME_DIST of the average order amount for each month

Answer 3:
Here is a SQL query that calculates the cumulative distribution of average order amounts per month:

```
-- Create a temporary table with monthly order amounts
WITH MonthlyOrderAmounts AS (
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) AS month, AVG(o.total_amount) AS avg_order_amount
    FROM Orders o
    GROUP BY month
)
-- Select the month, average order amount, and cumulative distribution
SELECT month, avg_order_amount, CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY avg_order_amount DESC) AS cume_dist
FROM MonthlyOrderAmounts;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The code creates a temporary table called `MonthlyOrderAmounts` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The `MONTH` column in the `MonthlyOrderAmounts` table is calculated by truncating the `order_date` column to the month level using the `DATE_TRUNC` function.
3. The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average order amount for each month.
4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by month.
5. The main query selects the `month`, `avg_order_amount`, and `CUME_DIST` columns.
6. The `CUME_DIST` function calculates the cumulative distribution of the `avg_order_amount` column, ordered in descending order.

Summary: This SQL query calculates the average order amount per month and the cumulative distribution of those amounts.

Prompt 4:
Identify the top 3 products by total quantity sold

Answer 4:
Here is a SQL query that calculates the cumulative distribution of the top 3 best-selling products:

```
-- Create a temporary table called ProductSales that contains the name of each product and the total quantity sold for each product
WITH ProductSales AS (
    SELECT p.name AS product_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
    FROM Products p
    JOIN Order_Items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY p.name
)
-- Select the product name, total quantity sold, and the cumulative distribution of the total quantity sold for each product, ordered by the total quantity sold in descending order
SELECT product_name, total_quantity_sold, CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC) AS cume_dist
FROM ProductSales
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `ProductSales` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The `ProductSales` table contains the name of each product and the total quantity sold for each product.
3. The `JOIN` clause is used to join the `Products` and `Order_Items` tables on the `product_id` column.
4. The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total quantity sold for each product.
5. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by product name.
6. The main query selects the product name, total quantity sold, and the cumulative distribution of the total quantity sold for each product.
7. The `CUME_DIST` function is used to calculate the cumulative distribution of the total quantity sold for each product.
8. The `OVER` clause is used to specify the order in which the cumulative distribution is calculated (in this case, by the total quantity sold in descending order).
9. The results are ordered by the total quantity sold in descending order.
10. The `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the results to the top 3 best-selling products.

Summary: This SQL query calculates the cumulative distribution of the top 3 best-selling products by joining the `Products` and `Order_Items` tables, grouping the results by product name, and using the `CUME_DIST` function to calculate the cumulative distribution of the total quantity sold for each product.

    SELECT c.name AS category_name, AVG(p.price) AS avg_price
    FROM Categories c
    JOIN Products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
    GROUP BY c.name
)
-- Select the category name, average price, and cumulative distribution over average price in descending order
SELECT category_name, avg_price, CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY avg_price DESC) AS cume_dist
FROM CategoryAvgPrice;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The code creates a temporary table called `CategoryAvgPrice` using a common table expression (CTE). The table contains the name of each category and the average price of all products in that category.
2. The `JOIN` clause is used to join the `Categories` and `Products` tables on the `category_id` column.
3. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by category name.
4. The `SELECT` statement selects the category name, average price, and cumulative distribution over average price in descending order.
5. The `CUME_DIST()` function calculates the cumulative distribution of the average prices over all categories. The `OVER()` clause specifies the order in which the function should be applied.

Summary: This SQL query calculates the average price for each category and then calculates the cumulative distribution of those average prices in descending order.
