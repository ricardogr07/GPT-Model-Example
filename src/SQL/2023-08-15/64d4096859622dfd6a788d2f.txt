Tables:
Sure, here's an example with 5 tables:

# Orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
# Customers(customer_id, customer_name, city, state)
# OrderDetails(order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
# Products(product_id, product_name, category_id, supplier_id)
# Categories(category_id, category_name)

Prompt 1:
I'm sorry, but the tables you provided are not related to the question you asked. However, I can still help you with your question. Here's a query to find the last order date for each customer:

```
SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This query selects the customer_id and the maximum order_date for each customer from the Orders table, and groups the results by customer_id. The MAX function is used to find the latest order date for each customer.

Answer 1:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves the last order date for each customer:

```
-- Create a temporary table with the last order date for each customer
WITH LastOrderDates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, 
           LAST_VALUE(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_order_date
    FROM orders
)
-- Join the temporary table with the customers table to get the customer name
SELECT c.customer_name, l.last_order_date
FROM customers c
JOIN LastOrderDates l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `LastOrderDates` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The `LAST_VALUE` function is used to get the last order date for each customer. The `PARTITION BY` clause groups the orders by customer_id, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the orders by order_date. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause specifies that the window for the `LAST_VALUE` function includes all rows in the partition.
3. The `LastOrderDates` table is joined with the `customers` table on the `customer_id` column to get the customer name.
4. The final result set includes the customer name and their last order date.

Summary: This SQL query retrieves the last order date for each customer by creating a temporary table with the last order date for each customer and joining it with the customers table.

Prompt 2:
Calculate the total amount spent by each customer on their last order

Answer 2:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves the total amount spent by each customer on their last order:

```
-- Create a temporary table with the total amount spent by each customer on their last order
WITH LastOrderDetails AS (
    SELECT o.customer_id, od.quantity * od.price AS total_amount
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE o.order_date = (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders)
)
-- Join the temporary table with the customers table to retrieve the customer name
SELECT c.customer_name, l.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN LastOrderDetails l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `LastOrderDetails` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The CTE selects the `customer_id` and the total amount spent on the last order for each customer.
3. The total amount is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each product in the order by its price.
4. The CTE uses a subquery to find the maximum order date in the `orders` table, which corresponds to the last order for any customer.
5. The `WHERE` clause filters the orders and order details to only include the last order for each customer.
6. The main query joins the `LastOrderDetails` table with the `customers` table on the `customer_id` column.
7. The query selects the `customer_name` and `total_amount` columns from the joined table.

Summary: This SQL query retrieves the total amount spent by each customer on their last order by creating a temporary table with the total amount spent on the last order for each customer and joining it with the `customers` table to retrieve the customer name.

Prompt 3:
Find the last order date for each product category

Answer 3:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves the last order date for each category:

```SQL
-- Create a temporary table with the last order date for each category
WITH LastOrderDates AS (
    SELECT category_id, 
           LAST_VALUE(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY category_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_order_date
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
)
-- Join the temporary table with the categories table to get the category name
SELECT c.category_name, l.last_order_date
FROM categories c
JOIN LastOrderDates l ON c.category_id = l.category_id;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `LastOrderDates` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The CTE selects the `category_id` and the last order date for each category using the `LAST_VALUE` window function. The `PARTITION BY` clause partitions the data by `category_id`, and the `ORDER BY` clause orders the data by `order_date`. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause specifies the window frame to include all rows in the partition.
3. The CTE joins the `orders`, `order_details`, and `products` tables to get the `order_date` for each product.
4. The main query joins the `LastOrderDates` table with the `categories` table on the `category_id` column to get the category name.
5. The main query selects the `category_name` and `last_order_date` columns.

Summary: This SQL query retrieves the last order date for each category by creating a temporary table with the last order date for each product and then joining it with the categories table to get the category name.

Prompt 4:
Calculate the total quantity of each product sold on the last order

Answer 4:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves the total quantity of each product in the last order:

```
WITH LastOrderDetails AS (
    -- This subquery retrieves the total quantity of each product in the last order
    SELECT od.product_id, SUM(od.quantity) OVER(PARTITION BY od.product_id) AS total_quantity
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE o.order_date = (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders)
)
-- This query joins the subquery with the products table to retrieve the product names
SELECT p.product_name, l.total_quantity
FROM products p
JOIN LastOrderDetails l ON p.product_id = l.product_id;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The subquery `LastOrderDetails` retrieves the total quantity of each product in the last order. It does this by joining the `orders` and `order_details` tables and using the `SUM` window function to calculate the total quantity for each product.
2. The `WHERE` clause in the subquery filters the orders to only include the last order, which is determined by finding the maximum order date in the `orders` table.
3. The main query joins the `LastOrderDetails` subquery with the `products` table on the `product_id` column to retrieve the product names.
4. The result set includes the product name and the total quantity of that product in the last order.

Summary: This SQL query retrieves the product names and total quantities of each product in the last order.

Prompt 5:
Find the last order date for each supplier

Answer 5:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves the last order date for each supplier:

```SQL
-- Create a temporary table with the last order date for each supplier
WITH LastOrderDates AS (
    SELECT supplier_id, 
           LAST_VALUE(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY supplier_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_order_date
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
)
-- Join the temporary table with the suppliers table to get the supplier name
SELECT s.supplier_name, l.last_order_date
FROM suppliers s
JOIN LastOrderDates l ON s.supplier_id = l.supplier_id;
```

Step by step explanation:
1. The query creates a temporary table called `LastOrderDates` using a common table expression (CTE).
2. The CTE selects the `supplier_id` and the last order date for each supplier using the `LAST_VALUE` window function. The `PARTITION BY` clause partitions the data by `supplier_id`, and the `ORDER BY` clause orders the data by `order_date`. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause specifies the window frame to include all rows in the partition.
3. The CTE joins the `orders`, `order_details`, and `products` tables to get the `order_date` for each product ordered by each supplier.
4. The main query joins the `LastOrderDates` table with the `suppliers` table on `supplier_id` to get the `supplier_name`.
5. The main query selects the `supplier_name` and `last_order_date` columns.

Summary: This SQL query retrieves the last order date for each supplier by creating a temporary table with the last order date for each product ordered by each supplier, and then joining that table with the `suppliers` table to get the supplier name.
